# React Tooltip

Created a simple tooltip component such that when I hover over a button it shows me a tooltip.

#

- We have created our tooltip component and render inside the app.js

- We have also looped our component using map function to pass all the position _i.e_ **right**, **top**, **left**, **bottom** to our component

- Once we get the position as props, we have created one function that will handle the position of tooltip as per position and return the styling to our div component

> We all know that react provide does not provide on hover event but it provide as the mechanism to detect this event using **onMouseEnter** _&&_ **onMouseLeave**

- We have manage our state using **onMouseEnter** _&&_ **onMouseLeave** functionality
